/**
 * A BoundedDeque is a sequential structure with restricted access and
 * limited capacity.
 * <p>
 * Access is available only at the ends of the structure:
 * <tt>addFront(E)</tt>, <tt>E removeFront()</tt>, and <tt>E peekFront()</tt>
 * operate on the front of the list; 
 * <tt>addBack(E)</tt>, <tt>E removeBack()</tt>, and <tt>E peekBack()</tt>
 * operate on the back of the list.
 * <p>
 * (A sequential structure which, like BoundedDeque, permits access
 * and modification only at the ends is sometimes called a "deque",
 * pronounced "deck", which is short for "double-ended queue.")
 * <p>
 * An implementation of BoundedDeque must allow duplicate elements,
 * but must not permit <tt>null</tt> elements, since some of the methods
 * use <tt>null</tt> as a signaling return value.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the methods required in the definition of this interface,
 * a class implementing this interface should provide a public constructor
 * with a single argument of type <tt>int</tt>, which specifies the
 * capacity of the BoundedDeque.  The constructor should throw an
 * IllegalArgumentException if the specified capacity is negative.

<h1>Learn C++ Overview:</h1>

C++ is middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level langauge features

<h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
	<ul>
		Encapsulation
		Data Hiding
		Inheritance
		Polymorphism
	</ul>

<h2>Standard Libraries:</h2>
	
		<ul>
			<ol>
				1. The core language giving all the building blocks including variables, data types and literals
			</ol>
			<ol>
				2. The C++ standard Library giving a rich set functions manipulating files, strings
			</ol>
			<ol>
				3. The standard Template Library(STL) giving a rich set of methods manipulating data structures
			</ol>
		</ul>

<h2>Linux Installation</h2>

		Check version of C++: g++ -v


<h2>C++ Program basic idea</h2>

	<ul>
		<ol>
			<b>Object</b> - objects have properties and behaviors. 
			Example: A dog has properties - color, name, breed as well as behaviors - wagging, barking, eating. 
			An object is an instance of a class.

			狗会有很多不同的性质，但是object是它的实例。
		</ol>
		<ol>
			<b>Class</b> - A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support.

			蓝图，模板
		</ol>
		<ol>
			<b>Methods</b> - A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.
			
			一个class里面可以有多个methods，methods是要逻辑性写出，data是会被处理的
		</ol>
		<ol>
			<b>Instance Variables</b> - Each obejct has its unique set of instance variables. An obejct's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.

			每个object都有自己的特殊的一套实例vars, object
		</ol>
	</ul>
